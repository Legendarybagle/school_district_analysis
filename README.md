# school_district_analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to give Maria and the school district the data again, bat taking into account the innacuracy of the Thomas High School 9th grade results. The goal was to erase the incorrect math and reading scores of the Thomas High School 9th graders while keeping the rest of the data intact and then redoing the analysis from earlier.

## Results
  *Thomas High School's overally passing percentage did not significantly change when the 9th graders were removed. on both an individual school level and a distrit level
  * The preformance of the school remaimed practically the same and therefore its ranking among other schools did not change either.
  * Since it was a charter school these images show before and after removing the incorrect data
